  In TypeScript, Union Types and Intersection Types are two important features.

1. Union Types (|): Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types of values. For example, a variable can be of type string | number, which means it can either be a string or a number. This allows you to handle multiple types of values in a single variable, enabling more flexible and dynamic behavior in your code.

2. Intersection Types (&): Intersection types combine multiple types into a single new type. For example, if you have a Person type and a Contact type, an intersection type like Person & Contact will include all the properties from both types. This ensures that a value must have all the properties from both types, effectively combining them into a new type that requires all the values.
